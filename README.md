# GifTastic

===============

    Here is a project in which I had to make an API call to populate the page.

The search will be according to the name of the button or the buttons you make.

You have to press the image to play/pause the GIFS.

Focused on just doing a simple API.

The technologies I used were HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, API, and GIT Bash.

# How To Use

Lets look at some car Gifs. Just type in a car to see what comes up.

By pressing the buttons up top; your page will be uploaded with related GIFS.

By filling in the input and pressing the add car button.
You can add more buttons.

To start watching the GIFS just simply press on the one you want to watch or stop it from playing 
if your tired of it looping.
